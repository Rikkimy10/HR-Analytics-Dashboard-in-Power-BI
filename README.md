# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-in-Power-BI



**Project Overview:**
The HR Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive tool built in Power BI to monitor key HR metrics, enabling data-driven insights into employee attendance, work-from-home (WFH) trends, and sick leave (SL) patterns. The dashboard is designed to help HR teams, managers, and decision-makers understand workforce engagement and attendance behaviors, improve resource planning, and identify trends over time.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Visualize Attendance and WFH Patterns** - Track attendance and WFH percentages across the organization and understand daily, weekly, and monthly trends.
2. **Monitor Sick Leave Trends** - Observe patterns in sick leave to identify any spikes or concerning trends that may require attention.
3. **Enable Data-Driven Decision Making** - Provide HR teams with actionable insights to make informed decisions regarding employee management, attendance policies, and remote work strategies.

**Features and Functionalities:**
1. **KPI Summary Section**:
   - Displays overall Attendance %, WFH %, and SL % at a glance, providing a quick overview of key HR metrics.
   - Percentages are calculated across the entire organization and updated dynamically.

2. **Trend Analysis Visualizations**:
   - **Attendance Over Time**: Line and area charts illustrate attendance percentages over a specified date range, highlighting trends and fluctuations. The dashboard includes trend lines to indicate attendance stability or seasonal variations.
   - **SL % Over Time**: Displays the sick leave percentage trend, allowing HR teams to detect peaks and potential health issues in the workforce.
   - **WFH % Over Time**: Tracks the percentage of work-from-home days over time, which helps assess the popularity of remote work and identify any unusual patterns in WFH rates.

3. **Day of the Week Analysis**:
   - Breakdowns of Attendance %, SL %, and WFH % by day of the week help in identifying any specific patterns, such as higher absenteeism on certain days (e.g., Fridays) or higher WFH usage on particular weekdays.

4. **Employee Attendance Breakdown**:
   - A detailed table showing individual employee data, including Attendance %, Present Days, and WFH %. Each row represents an employee, and data is sorted to identify patterns at the individual level.
   - Filters and slicers allow users to search and filter by Employee ID, making it easy to focus on specific employees or departments.

5. **Daily Attendance Record**:
   - A tabular view of daily attendance records for each employee, indicating attendance status (Present, WFH, Sick Leave, etc.) across multiple dates.
   - This section allows HR personnel to monitor daily attendance behaviors, providing insights for performance reviews or attendance policy adjustments.

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraged Power BI’s visualization tools, including line charts, area charts, tables, and KPI cards, to create an engaging and informative layout.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilized Power BI’s data transformation tools to clean, prepare, and structure data from various HR sources.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Implemented slicers and filters for date range, day of the week, and Employee ID, allowing for a tailored user experience.
- **Interactivity**: Integrated interactive elements, such as tooltips and conditional formatting, to enhance user experience and data interpretability.

**Impact and Insights**:
- Enabled the HR team to quickly assess overall attendance and remote work patterns, supporting decisions on flexible work policies.
- Facilitated the identification of specific days with lower attendance, enabling HR to take proactive measures.
- Provided the ability to monitor SL trends, helping HR manage health-related policies and employee wellness initiatives effectively.

**Tools and Technologies**:
- **Power BI**: For creating the dashboard, visualizations, and interactive elements.
- **Excel** (or other data sources): Used for initial data collection and cleansing before importing into Power BI.

**Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring that all data was clean and accurate was essential for reliable analytics. Implemented data transformation steps to handle inconsistencies and missing data.
- **Performance Optimization**: As the dashboard processes large datasets, optimized data models and relationships to ensure smooth performance and quick loading times.
